\section{\textnormal{Introduction}} \noindent

Digitalization of technological processes is one of the most effective ways to improve the efficiency of both
individual enterprises and entire industries. This fully
applies to railway transport.

For these purposes, the Belarusian Railway has implemented a number of projects on the informatization of
key technological processes. The Information and Analytical Management Decision Support System for Freight
Transportation (IAMDSS FT) provides specialists and
managers at all levels with prompt and reliable information about freight transportation that are being performed
and were performed, the condition and location of the
wagon and locomotive fleets. The Unified Corporate
Integrated Financial and Resource Management System
(UC IFRMS) based on SAP SE products is designed
for effective information support of planning, modeling
and operational management of financial and economic
activities of the BR divisions.

The creation of the Transportation Management Center and its equipping with automated dispatch control
systems using "Neman" software and hardware has been
completed, the development of train schedules using
"Grafist" automated control systems has been automated,
and separate planning procedures have been automated.
At the line level, there are automated management systems for stations and linear areas (AMSS, AMSLA), a
system for automating the preparation and processing of
station and commercial reporting documents (SAPPD).
\columnbreak

The implementation of the above-mentioned and a
number of other systems made it possible to create a
fairly detailed and complete database on the transportation process and the railway as a whole. At the same time,
information technologies operating in railway transport
make it possible to implement only certain functions
of the management cycle, entrusting the procedures for
forming, evaluating and making managerial decisions
(MD) entirely to a human.

The greatest problems arise with significant deviations from pre-developed technologies (delay of a passenger
train, shortage of capacity of the station’s fleet, lack of
empty wagons for loading, etc.). It is at those moments,
when a person needs help in making managerial decisions, that modern automated systems are not effective
enough. In such conditions, a person, as a rule, when
searching for rational MD, resorts to his experience
based on partially unformalized knowledge and empirical
experience, and to a lesser extent relies on the help of
information systems.

Next logical stage in the development of information
technologies in railway transport is the transition from
information and reference systems to information and
analytical and information management systems. In this
regard, as foundation for the digital transformation of
railway transport is proposed to consider an intelligent
transportation process management system (ITPMS).

The development of the ITPMS presupposes the existence of unified ways to describe the system and the
processes occurring in it — ontologies. [1]

\section{\textnormal{The concept and basis of ontology}}
\end{center}
The use of a single "metaplatform" contributes to
the improvement of transport processes, simplification of
document flow and acceleration of information exchange
between participants in multimodal transportation. This
approach leads to a synergistic effect on three levels:
within each mode of transport, between different modes
of transport and in the transport complex as a whole.

However, the development of such systems faces a
huge amount of information that needs to be integrated
and coordinated within a single digital platform. Data

sources are often disparate even within a single company,
and the information contained in them can be duplicated, diverse, and have complex relationships such as
synonymy and mero-holonymy. The complexity of the
task increases exponentially when scaled to the level of
the entire transport system or the transport complex as a
whole.

In the field of multimodal transportation, the active
use of knowledge brings significant benefits to all participants. For example, successful innovative solutions that
were once used and accelerated the movement of goods
in the logistics chain or brought additional profits are
becoming available to everyone. The ability to generate
new knowledge can help to find such solutions, even if
they have not been used before. Ontologies, as well as
frame models of knowledge representation, are the basis
of such solutions [2].

Ontologies can be classified into four levels depending
on their goals:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label=\arabic*)]
\item Representation Ontology: They define the domain
of knowledge representation and serve as the basis
for creating a specification language for lower-level
ontologies.
\item Top-level Ontologies: They describe abstract interdisciplinary concepts and the connections between
them. Such ontologies capture general knowledge
applicable in several subject areas.
\item Domain Ontology: They describe and summarize
concepts specific to a particular subject area.
\item Applied Ontologies: They describe the conceptual
model of a specific task or application.
\end{enumerate}
\par
The following approaches are distinguished within
these levels:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Formal taxonomies: They define a "class-subclass"
 relationship and ensure the transitivity of this relationship.

 \item Formal instances: They define a "class-instance"
 relationship and add instances to the class hierarchy.

 \item Disjunctive classes, inverse properties: They allow
you  to declare two classes disjoint and allow you to
make  not only direct inference, but also reverse.

 \item Ontologies with restrictions on the scope of property  values:  Property values are selected from a
predefined  set or subset of concepts.

 \item Frame-based properties: Each class can also have
slots  containing information about its properties,
also they can  be inherited by classes of higher levels.

 \item Arbitrary logical constraints: Allow you to define
 arbitrary axioms.
 \end{itemize}

Ontologies can also be classified by content into: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item General Ontologies: They describe the most general
concepts, independent of specific problems or areas.

 \item Task ontologies: They reflect the specifics of particular applications, tasks or programs.
\end{itemize}
    \columnbreak
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Subject ontologies: They describe real objects used
     in a  certain activity.
    \end{itemize}

According to Gruber’s definition [4], an ontology is an
explicit specification of a conceptualization, a formalized
representation of concepts and the connections between
them. Formally, it has the form
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, label={}]
\item \emph{< C, R, P, A >},
\item where
\item \emph{C} is a set of concepts of a specific subject area,
\item \emph{R} is the set of relations between concepts,
\item \emph{P} is the set of attributes of concepts,
\item \emph{A} is a set of axioms.
\end{itemize}

\section{\textnormal{Current state of ontologies in railway transportation}} \noindent

The process of creating ontologies is complex and nontrivial. When developing them, as a rule, experts from
different fields are involved (in the subject area, linguists,
programmers, etc.), each of whom applies their own
methods of work. But there are still no universal methods,
and the correctness of the result obtained is determined
specifically for each particular task. [5], [6] Ontological
analysis determines the functional structure (connections
between objects) and determines the behavior of the
system (scenarios).

The existing IDEF5 [3] standard describes the construction of ontologies in a very simplified way. Due to
the lack of a theoretical methodology for determining
the structure of information, the task of finding the fundamental foundations for creating a developed transport
ontology is urgent.

At the moment, ontologies are used in intelligent railway transport management systems (IRTMS) both in JSC
"Russian Railways" and on the railways of the European
Union. However, the analysis of these ontologies shows
that they are rather intended for storing and consolidating
data on the state of various objects of the transportation
process. They are applied and are not currently focused
on expanding to the entire subject area.
\end{multicols}
\newpage
\begin{multicols}{2}\noindent \par
The ontologies used on the railways of the European Union are even more narrowly oriented and do
not include the more abstract, technological level of
knowledge that is present in the ontologies of this field.
One of the reasons for the inapplicability of Western
ontologies is the structural difference of the railway
system. The terminology sets describing the Belarusian
Railway and European railways differ significantly. Despite the presence of common concepts at a high level,
such as "Station" and "Wagon", at lower levels, such as
classification of wagons, tracks, document management
and others, the terms are fundamentally different.

Nevertheless, the ontology being formed should be
interdisciplinary, since various modes of transport with
their own technology and specifics of work, regulatory
documents, loading and unloading regulations, etc. participate in transportation. To ensure internal consistency
of ontologies, it is necessary to determine a common
"point" around which they can be combined. In this
case, such a unifying "point" may be cargo, and then
the subject area will be "cargo transportation".

Thus, the use of foreign ontologies is not possible,
and in the case of integration with European systems,
the ontology will have to contain universal concepts
describing those concepts in a form understandable to
both sides

It should also be noted that the railway infrastructure
is a strategically important facility. Thus, this area should
be import-independent. And one of the problems of the
existing ontology used in IRTMS is the dependence on
Western instruments.

Despite the fact that, at first glance, it is sufficient to
consider the ITPMS as an ontology of the subject area, it
must be borne in mind that the ITPMS is the first stage
in building an Intelligent Transport Management System
and must have all the features of top-level ontologies.
This task is inextricably linked with the formation of
a digital model of the transportation process (DMTP).
The current mechanisms for the formation of the DMTP
should allow for online modeling of the state of the
transportation process. This requires the unification of
requirements for the content and form of presentation of
information about the parameters of the functioning of
objects. DMTP may include:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item models of objects (including resources);
    \item process models — description of processes occurring both in the ITPMS and in the external object
environment;
    \item models of the external object environment describing the external impact on the objects of the transportation process;
    \item models of predicting situations — study of options
for the development of the transport situation with
abnormal changes in the state of elements of the
transport system, the external environment, with
\columnbreak
changes in the characteristics of information flows;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item models for the formation of managerial decisions
that provide an analysis of the operational situation
and the formation of effective managerial decision;
    \item evaluation models that provide an assessment of the
effectiveness of implemented MD, the condition of
facilities and the parameters of the transportation
process.
\end{itemize}

The basis for the formation of the ontology under
consideration can be the subsystem of the normativereference information of IAMDSS FT (SNRI). This
subsystem contains many tables describing both static
and dynamic objects. However, in its pure form, SNRI
does not allow solving operational tasks, but is used only
as reference information. Thus, the scientific problem of
developing tools for the transformation of normativereference information into an ontological description
of both the subject area and interdisciplinary concepts
should be solved.

\section{\textnormal{Our proposal on the direction of research in the
field of development of railway transport ontology.}} 

In our work we propose to use the OSTIS technology
and platform, which is being developed in the Republic
of Belarus. Within the framework of this technology,
tools for creating ontologies are implemented, as well
as creating agents to work with it. [7]–[10]

Based on the above justifications of relevance, the
following tasks can be distinguished for ontology:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Fully describe the objects and processes of the
transportation process.
    \item Converting information from existing standards to a
knowledge base and back.
    \item Set of agents for data transformation
    \item Storage and analysis of external information.
    \item Storage of managing decision models.
    \item Set of agents for converting incoming information
into a managing decision.
\end{itemize}\par
Accordingly, the Knowledge Base can be divided into
subdomains.
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label=\arabic*)]
    \item Description of the main objects involved in the
transportation process;
    \item Description of the processes occurring in the
ITPMS, as well as external processes affecting the
ITPMS;
    \item Description of external objects that affect the transportation process;
    \item Description of possible emergency situations, models for predicting their development;
    \item Description of possible managing decisions;
    \item Description of criteria for evaluating managing
decisions and the result of their impact on the
system.
    \end{enumerate}\par
